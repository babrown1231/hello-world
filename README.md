# hello-world
My name is Brittany Brown. I received my Bachelor's degree in psychology and currently work in benefits. 
While earning my degree I took a Computer Applied Statistics course. 
I learned a little bit about R and SAS, and have been interested in programming since. 
Most everyone in my immediate and extended family works in IT, so it seems natural that I have found myself swaying this way eventually. 
I am excited to start this program and look forward to learning new things!
